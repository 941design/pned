** TODO
  1. Create test for listener removal on dispose
  2. Start emacs with a script parameter to do the export on a maven build
  3. Create a TransitionStyle object
  4. File not found throws uncaught exception
  5. Firing un-activated transition throws uncaught exception. Suspend
     listener?
  6. Refactor node movement (multi-selection) into AWT component
     listener. Fire the current nodemoved event only when movement
     finished.
  7. Add padding to labels
  8. Make labels and their fonts resizable.
  9. Allow to remove selected nodes with DEL. (Add key listener to
     PnFrame to send a generic deletion event?)
  10. Abort Edge creation with ESC. (Add key listener to PnFrame to
      send a generic abort event?)
  11. Add confirmation buttons to settings dialog
  12. [TEST] - Create two nodes with same id.
  13. Node selection and removal has two events each that do
      essentially the same thing
  14. Decouple state and event bus
  15. Improve threading of requests. (reuse threads, kill them when
      done, etc.)
  16. A simple Map<String, AbstractNode> would obsolete the NodeRequest
  17. Create test for XML round-trip
  18. Optically nicer edit settings dialog
  19. Include color pickers in edit settings dialog
  20. Instead of XML annotations create a JAXB config file to decouple
      the DefaultPetriNet from .pned.io
  21. Simplify listeners to have one listener per component in each
      package .pned.core and .pned.gui.components
  22. Define a behaviour for dragging out of bounds
  23. Smoothen enlargement of scroll pane
  24. Create toolbar symbols for edit operations
  25. For outgoing edges - always draw the first segment invisible
  26. Start an issue-tracker for this project
  27. Adjust EdgeComponent size when moving (Profile which is better -
      maximizing edge components or minimizing their bounds and
      adjusting when necessary)
  28. Only fire component enter events for accepted components (edge).
  29. Create unfinished edge component in addition to the normal edge
      component
  30. Add name of current file to status (name) bar
  31. Show popup if single nodes are selected
  32. Change to JDK8
  33. Include grid color in settings
  34. Make node shapes and styles pluggable

** ideas
   Instead of suspending listeners, I could also create MouseAdapters
   for each component which manage state and do not forward events
   unless state criteria is met!  dispatchEvent(e) would have to be
   overwritten in that component. I would state-dependent dispatch to
   selected listeners only.  One could randomly add listeners and
   never worry about suspending them any more.
